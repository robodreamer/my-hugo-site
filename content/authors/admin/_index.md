I am an experienced robotics specialist with a passion for solving complex problems and a hands-on approach. With a background in kinematics, dynamics, and control of redundant manipulators, I have extensive experience in simulating multi-degree-of-freedom systems, whole-body motion generation for humanoid robots, and coordination of multi-robot systems.\
\
I am proficient in working with hardware components, including motors, sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers, and my ultimate goal is to make cutting-edge technology practical and user-friendly, providing an intuitive user experience.\
\
I am proud to have extensive experience in deploying real products in large scale medical and industrial settings, where I have been able to showcase my skills in developing innovative solutions in the field of robotics. I am confident that my skills and experiences can contribute to the success of your projects and initiatives.

In past lives, I…

* led advanced numerical IK solver development for multi-arm surgical robot system at KUKA Boston R&D
* developed force and impedance control behaviors for manipulation tasks at RethinkRobotics
* did my PhD on representation and control of coordinated motion/force tasks of multi-arm and human-robot systems at Purdue ARTLab
* designed and built small-sized humanoid robots and mobile robots at Kwangwoon University in S. Korea

I am currently focusing on creating advanced AI-powered manipulation abilities to enhance robots' functionality and usefulness as assistants in diverse everyday human environments at [Boston Dynamics AI Institute](https://theaiinstitute.com/).
